# pscale-touchstone

The reference you check your blocks against.

A **touchstone** is what you test things against — you rub your gold on it to see if it's real. Are your spindles producing coherent context? Touch them against the touchstone.

The block inside a hermitcrab shell is the **keystone** (it holds the arch together). This repo is the **touchstone** — the place you go to verify, compare, and calibrate.

## What is pscale?

Semantic numbers that address meaning, not quantity. Nested JSON where:
- Digit keys `0-9` are children
- `_` holds text content  
- Nesting depth IS the scale

## Files

- **`keystone.json`** — Operational specification (~4100 tokens, boot-ready for LLM system prompts)
- **`keystone-full.json`** — Complete v4 reference including speculative structures (resonance mapping, density compression, standing wave, torus topology)
- **`fundamentals-typology.md`** — The combinatorial variables that generate all block types

## How to Use

1. Read `keystone.json` pscale 0 — it tells you everything
2. Fork this repo
3. Create domain-specific keystones for your problem space
4. The operational keystone is the smallest stone that holds the arch
