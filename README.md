# pscale-touchstone

The **touchstone** for pscale JSON blocks — a self-describing rendition block that teaches any mind (human or LLM) how to read, write, navigate, and grow semantic number structures.

A touchstone is what you test things against — you rub your gold on it to see if it's real. This block is the reference surface for pscale: if a block follows the format described here, it works.

## Files

- **touchstone.json** — Operational touchstone. Lean, boot-ready (~4100 tokens). What goes in a hermitcrab shell.
- **touchstone-full.json** — Complete v4 reference including speculative structures (resonance mapping, density compression, standing wave, topological combination).
- **fundamentals-typology.md** — The combinatorial variables that generate the space of possible block types.

## What is a pscale block?

Nested JSON where digit keys (0-9) address meaning at different scales. Each nesting level is one pscale step. Content lives at the underscore key (`_`). The node at pscale 0 always describes what the block is and how to use it.

Read `touchstone.json` — it explains itself.

## Tuning fork

A **tuning fork** is a minimal vertical JSON defining what pscale depths mean for blocks sharing the same tuning number. The JSON field is `tuning` (terse, functional). In prose, say tuning fork — a resonance reference, not an authority. Like musicians using the same reference tone to get in tune with each other, without a conductor. A set of tuning forks, like a piano technician's kit.
